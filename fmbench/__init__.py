"""
fmbench: Simple CLI utilities for AI4H-inspired foundation model benchmarks.

This package provides:
- A small command-line interface (CLI) for listing benchmark suites and running
  toy evaluations locally.
- Helpers for building Markdown leaderboards from YAML metadata.

The CLI is intentionally lightweight and opinionated so it can be used as a
reference implementation and extended as the project matures.
