model_id: flamingo
name: Flamingo
modality: multimodal
upstream_repo: https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_flamingo
notes: 'Visual language model that bridges pretrained vision encoders and language
  models via a Perceiver

  Resampler and gated cross-attention layers, enabling few-shot image and video understanding
  from

  in-context examples alone. Implemented in the OpenFlamingo codebase as a flexible
  framework for

  training and evaluating Flamingo-style VLMs.

  '
arch: Perceiver-augmented VLM (vision encoder + LM + gated cross-attention)
params: 3B / 4B / 9B checkpoints (OpenFlamingo variants)
