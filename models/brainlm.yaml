model_id: brainlm
name: BrainLM
modality: brain
upstream_repo: https://github.com/vandijklab/BrainLM
notes: Masked autoencoding language model for fMRI voxel time-series. Uses ViT-MAE
  scaffolding with custom BrainLM embeddings that mix voxel coordinates and patched
  time windows to learn denoised cortical dynamics.
arch: ViT-MAE + Nystromformer encoder/decoder
params: 111M / 650M
