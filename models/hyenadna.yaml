notes: 'Genomic foundation model that uses Hyena implicit-convolution operators to
  model DNA sequences at

  single-nucleotide resolution with context lengths up to 1M tokens. Pretrained as
  a decoder-only

  language model on the human reference genome, HyenaDNA achieves strong performance
  on regulatory

  element benchmarks while using far fewer parameters and less data than attention-based
  DNA LMs.
