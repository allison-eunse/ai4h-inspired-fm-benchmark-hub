modality: multimodal

notes: 'Whole-slide foundation model that aggregates CONCH v1.5 patch embeddings into
  slide-level

  transformers, aligned with paired pathology reports and synthetic captions through
  a CoCa-style

  objective. Public release includes slide/text encoders (decoder removed), Hugging
  Face weights,

  and scripts for finetuning, linear probing, zero-shot slide retrieval, and pathology
  report

  generation across TCGA-OT/UT datasets.
