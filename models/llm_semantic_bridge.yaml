name: LLM semantic bridge (multimodal hub)
modality: multimodal
upstream_repo: TBD (ARPA-H Brain-Omics Model hub LLM)
notes: "Documentation-only card describing an ARPA-H\u2013style large language model\
  \ (LLM) used as a common semantic hub\nfor brain, EEG/EPhys, and multi-omics foundation\
  \ model embeddings. The LLM receives subject-level embeddings\nfrom Brain FMs, EPhys/EEG\
  \ FMs, and Multi-Omics FMs via adapters or cross-attention, and produces textual\n\
  explanations, reasoning chains, and structured reports.\n"
arch: Decoder-only LLM + cross-modal adapters
