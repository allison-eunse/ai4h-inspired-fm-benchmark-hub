model_id: brainharmony
name: Brain Harmony
modality: brain
upstream_repo: external_repos/brainharmony
notes: Multimodal brain foundation model that unifies structural MRI (morphology)
  and fMRI (function) using Temporal Adaptive Patch Embedding (TAPE) and hub tokens
  to handle heterogeneous TRs and fuse modalities into a shared latent space.
arch: Transformer with TAPE + hub-token fusion
params: TBD
