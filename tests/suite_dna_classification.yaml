# DEL7.x: Test Suite Specification
# DNA Sequence Classification Suite

suite_id: "SUITE-DNA-CLASS"
name: "DNA Sequence Classification Suite"
version: "1.0.0"

description: |
  Standard benchmark suite for evaluating DNA foundation models on 
  regulatory element classification tasks. Uses real experimental data
  from ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, and curated databases.

applicable_models:
  - "evo2"
  - "hyenadna"
  - "caduceus"
  - "dnabert2"
  - "nucleotide_transformer"

benchmarks:
  - benchmark_id: "BM-DNA-ENHANCER"
    dataset_id: "DS-DNA-ENHANCERS-COHN"
    description: "Enhancer vs non-enhancer classification"
    
  - benchmark_id: "BM-DNA-PROMOTER"
    dataset_id: "DS-DNA-PROMOTERS-NONTATA"
    description: "Promoter vs non-promoter classification"

evaluation:
  metrics:
    - AUROC
    - Accuracy
    - F1-Score
  
  output_artifacts:
    - eval.yaml
    - report.md

usage: |
  python -m fmbench run --suite SUITE-DNA-CLASS --model configs/model_evo2.yaml --out results/

notes: |
  This suite tests DNA FMs on their core competency: understanding
  regulatory grammar in DNA sequences. All data is real experimental
  data, not synthetic.
