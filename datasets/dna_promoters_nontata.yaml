description: |
  Binary classification of DNA sequences as promoters or non-promoters.
  Focuses on non-TATA promoters (the majority of human promoters).
  Curated from the Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPD).

modalities:
  - "DNA sequence"

data_type: "sequence_classification"
sequence_length: 251  # bp centered on TSS

n_train: 27097
n_test: 9034
n_classes: 2

labels:
  - "non-promoter"
  - "promoter"

format:
  file_type: "tsv"
  columns: ["sequence", "label"]
  
origin:
  database: "Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPD)"
  species: "Homo sapiens"
  genome_build: "hg38"

notes: |
  Standard benchmark for promoter prediction. Non-TATA promoters lack 
  the TATA box motif and represent ~75% of human promoters.
