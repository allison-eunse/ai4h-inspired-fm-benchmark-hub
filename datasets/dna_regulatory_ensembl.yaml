description: |
  Multi-class classification of DNA sequences into regulatory element types.
  Based on Ensembl Regulatory Build annotations derived from ENCODE and 
  Roadmap Epigenomics experimental data.

modalities:
  - "DNA sequence"

data_type: "sequence_classification"
sequence_length: 200  # bp

# Toy version: stratified subsample for quick testing
# Full dataset (231,348 samples): https://huggingface.co/datasets/katielink/genomic-benchmarks
