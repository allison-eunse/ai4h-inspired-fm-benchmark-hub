notes: 'UK Biobank WES-derived variant and gene-level features used in gene-embedding
  and polygenic analyses.

  This card describes the cohort and feature table layout for downstream genetics
  FMs (e.g., Caduceus, Evo2,

  DNABERT-2) and subject-level gene embeddings (e.g., genetics_gene_fm_pca512_v1,
  genetics_joo_mdd_cog_v1).
