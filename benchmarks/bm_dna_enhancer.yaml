# DEL3: System Requirement Specifications
# DNA Enhancer Classification Benchmark

benchmark_id: "BM-DNA-ENHANCER"
name: "DNA Enhancer Classification"
version: "1.0.0"

health_topic: "Genomics - Regulatory Element Prediction"
health_domain: "Genetics"
description: |
  Benchmark for classifying DNA sequences as enhancers or non-enhancers.
  Enhancers are distal regulatory elements that activate gene expression.
  Accurate enhancer prediction is critical for understanding gene regulation
  and identifying disease-associated variants.

clinical_relevance: |
  Enhancer variants are implicated in many diseases including cancer,
  cardiovascular disease, and developmental disorders. Accurate enhancer
  prediction helps prioritize variants for functional follow-up.
