# DNA Promoter Classification Benchmark

benchmark_id: "BM-DNA-PROMOTER"
name: "DNA Promoter Classification"
version: "1.0.0"

health_topic: "Genomics - Promoter Prediction"
health_domain: "Genetics"
description: |
  Benchmark for classifying DNA sequences as promoters or non-promoters.
  Promoters are regulatory regions at transcription start sites (TSS).
  This benchmark focuses on non-TATA promoters, which lack the canonical
  TATA box and represent ~75% of human promoters.

    - Accuracy
    - F1-Score
    - Precision
    - Recall

evaluation_protocol:
  split: "predefined"
  stratification: "label"
  
performance_targets:
  good: 0.85
  excellent: 0.92

clinical_relevance: |
  Promoter variants can disrupt gene expression and cause disease.
  Accurate promoter prediction is essential for interpreting variants
  in non-coding regions near gene starts.
